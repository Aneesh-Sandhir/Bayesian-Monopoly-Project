# Bayesian Machine Learning Monopoly Project (DS 6014 Final Project)

#### Aneesh Sandhir, Logan Yoonhyuk Lee, Taeheon Park

This is a copy of the repository my classmates and I put together during a project for our Bayesian Machine Learning Class. We modeled the game of monopoly as a Markov Chain and calculated the probabilities of landing on each square of the board and the expected number of opposition rolls needed for a player to make thier money back on a property improved to particular point as a function of the number sides of dice the game is being played with and the number of doubles one needs to roll before going to jail.

The report and slide deck we put together contain our findings, along with a more detailed description of our methodology, as well as a thought experiment we developed where we made the jail space a property which could be purchased and used to demand rent from one's opponents.
